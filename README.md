# Storefront Aggregator

A flexible and extensible content Aggregator for Storefront... Improves user experience and adds dynamic content to your pages.

## Description

The aggregators are registered as custom post type - Edit and manipulate them as such.<br />
You can attach to aggregators the desired type and amount of items and choose on which pages and which template action hook to display each aggregator... It is possible to add multiple aggregators on a single page and/or on a single template hook.<br />
By default, the available item types are 'Last Posts' and 'Last Comments'. Compatible with WooCommerce, you also can aggregate 'Last Products' or 'Last Reviews'.<br />
The aggregate items are slidable and fully responsive. Thanks to FlexSlider.<br />
Features a dedicated Customizer panel in which each aggregator can be deeply customized.

**Coming soon**
- Improved Customizer... More user friendly interface and further styling options such as aggregator layout, margins, etc...

## Extensibility

For devs, it allows seamless integration of **any** imaginable custom items. Just few examples:
- Last orders and/or last order notes on WooCommerce account page.
- Category items.
- RSS feeds.
- Etc... The possibilities are endless.

This is possible by the help of 2 filter hooks - `storefront_aggregator_meta_boxes` -  `storefront_aggregator_items` and 1 action hook - `storefront_aggregator_item_template`.<br />
You can take `includes/classes/class-storefront-aggregator-integration-woocommerce.php` as reference for the integration of your custom items.
