# Storefront Aggregator

A flexible and extensible content Aggregator for Storefront... Improves user experience and adds dynamic content to your pages.

## Description

The aggregators are registered as custom post type - Edit and manipulate them as such.<br />
You can attach to aggregators the desired amount of items and choose on which pages to display each aggregator. It is possible to display multiple aggregators on a single page.<br />
By default, the available item types are 'Last Posts' and 'Last Comments'. Compatible with WooCommerce, you also can aggregate 'Last Products' or 'Last Reviews'.<br />
The aggregate items are slidable and fully responsive. Thanks to FlexSlider.<br />
Features a dedicated Customizer section from which you can switch color of all aggregator's elements.

**Coming soon**
- Possibility to display each aggregator to the page and its template action hook of YOUR choice. This will bring interesting perspectives...
- Dynamically generated Customizer settings for **each** Aggregator including different choice of layouts and further styles.

## Extensibility

For devs, it allows seamless integration of **any** imaginable custom items. Just few examples:
- Last orders and/or last order notes on WooCommerce account page.
- Category items.
- RSS feeds.
- Etc... The possibilities are endless.

All this is possible with the help of 2 filter hooks - `storefront_aggregator_meta_boxes` -  `storefront_aggregator_query_items` and 1 action hook - `storefront_aggregator_item_template`.<br />
You can take `integration/woocommerce` as reference for the integration of your custom items.
